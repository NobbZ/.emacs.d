This is my work in progress [[http://http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][=emacs=]]-config.

You can read [[file:settings.org][=settings.org=]] for further details.

If you want to try it out on your own, be warned, that it might be
slightly misconfigured and also be tied to my machine(s).

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mv ~/emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak # back up old emacs-stuff
  git clone --origin upstream https://github.com/NobbZ/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
